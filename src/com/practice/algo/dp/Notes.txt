- Why Is the Bottom-Right Cell Important?
Let’s say:
You have 4 items, Your bag can hold up to 7 kg

The bottom row is: "I can use all 4 items"
The rightmost column is: "The bag can carry up to 7 kg"

So the bottom-right cell answers:
“What’s the maximum profit I can get by choosing from all items, and using up to full capacity of the bag?”
That’s exactly what the original problem is asking.
